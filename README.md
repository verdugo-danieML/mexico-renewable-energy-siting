# Renewable Energy Siting Assistant for Mexico (RESA-MX)

This project develops an artificial intelligence system to optimize the siting of renewable energy installations in Mexico. Using geospatial data from national agencies such as INEGI, CONAGUA, and CFE, along with advanced deep learning and computer vision techniques, RESA-MX aims to:

1. Analyze topographic, climatic, and infrastructure data to identify optimal sites for solar and wind energy.
2. Integrate environmental and socioeconomic considerations into the selection process.
3. Generate interactive heat maps and detailed recommendations for renewable energy project planning.
4. Provide a decision support tool for developers, planners, and policymakers.

## Key features:
- Processing and analysis of high-resolution geospatial data
- Deep learning models for terrain evaluation and energy potential prediction
- Interactive web interface for result exploration
- Consideration of factors such as proximity to the power grid, road access, and land use restrictions
- Continuous updates with the latest data from Mexican agencies

This open-source project seeks to accelerate Mexico's transition to clean energy, contributing to the country's sustainability and climate change mitigation goals.
